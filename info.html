            Welcome to BlackJack vs. AI!<br><br>
            Your goal is simple: outlast or outwin the Agent, a trained blackjack machine learning algorithm. 
            The Agent always plays to the best of its ability, but it also always bets 1/3 of its chips (rounded to the nearest 10.)
            Can you beat the agent with your superior betting prowess?<br><br>
            Bets are above the cards, and your total chip count is below. You can bet in increments of 10 and Blackjack pays 1:1. 
            Cards dealt are random but weighted to a normal deck. Split and Double are not available.<br><br>
            The Agent is a monte-carlo reinforcement-trained statistical model. It was trained over 250000 episodes to produce a 43.3% winrate.<br><br>
