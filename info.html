            Welcome to BlackJack vs. AI!<br><br>
            Your goal is simple: outlast or outwin the Agent, a trained blackjack machine learning algorithm. 
            The Agent always plays to the best of its ability, but it also always bets 1/3 of its chips (rounded to the nearest 10.)
            Can you beat the agent with your superior betting prowess?<br><br>
            Bets are above the cards, and your total chip count is below. You can bet in increments of 10. Standard blackjack rules, and the deck is reshuffled each hand.
            Split and Double are not available.<br><br>
            The Agent is a monte-carlo simulation reinforcement-trained statistical model. It was trained over 35000 samples to produce a 42.4% winrate.<br><br>
